    "explanation": "Based on the conversation, it is likely that the issue can be resolved quickly as the cause of the problem (conflict with third-party antivirus tools) is relatively straightforward and easy to address. Additionally, the agent has provided a direct download link as a potential solution, which will save time compared to troubleshooting and investigating other possible causes. Therefore, I estimate that it will take around 1.5 hours to resolve the issue."
